## **DAY 1- 17th June 2025: Started out with the Project**

Reasearched and planned out on what features the transmitter will have searched for the componets read the Datasheets. Since its my first time using esp32 s3 so i had to read the datasheet and look at example circuits properly. So, finally will be using these
- ESP32 S3 Wroom 1u
- SSD1309 2.42 inch oled
- 2 joysticks 2 potentiometes and 4 switched.
- nrf24l01 for rf communication.

## **Day 3 - 24th June 2025 : PCB AND CAD**

Completed the PCB and started and complted a major chunk of the front portion of the transmitter where all the joysticks switches and Joysticks will be connected to.
The majority of the time was spent making the CAD. However its still not completed since i still need to make a place to hold the PCB in place.
